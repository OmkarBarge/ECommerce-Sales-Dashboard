# ECommerce-Sales-Dashboard

<h1>ECommerce Sales Dashboard using PowerBI</h1>
The project involved the creation of a Power BI dashboard using an e-commerce sales dataset. The main objective was to gain valuable insights and visualize the sales data through various charts and slicers. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different dimensions and enables users to explore the data in an interactive and intuitive manner.<br>
The following key components were included in the dashboard:
Amount by State<br>
Quantity by Category<br>
Amount by Customer Name(TOP 5)<br>
Quantity by Payment Mode<br>
Profit by Month<br>
Profit by Sub-Category<br>
Slicer on Quarterly Basis<br>
Slicer for Selecting Specific State<br>

By combining these charts and slicers, the dashboard offers a holistic view of the e-commerce sales data. Users can identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for growth by analyzing sales amounts, quantities, profits, and customer behavior across various dimensions. The interactive nature of the dashboard empowers users to drill down into specific areas of interest and make informed business decisions based on the insights derived from the data.<br>
